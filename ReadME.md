# Trade Area Modeling
According to [Market Business News](https://marketbusinessnews.com/financial-glossary/trade-area-definition-meaning/), a trade (or market) area is the geographical area  where all or most of a business' sales volume occurs. It can be used to make decisions about the optimum location for physical business expansion.

This repository contains two notebooks:
1. [Trade Area Data Mining](https://github.com/ItunuoluwaOlowoye/Trade-Area-Modelling/blob/main/Trade%20Area%20Data%20Mining.ipynb): The notebook to mine data on neighborhood boundaries, customer population, retail store details, distance and traffic indices, and store attractiveness features for the model.
2. [Trade Area Model](https://github.com/ItunuoluwaOlowoye/Trade-Area-Modelling/blob/main/Trade%20Area%20Model.ipynb): The notebook where the trade area model is built and the optimum store location is chosen.

The model was deployed with Streamlit and can be accessed [here](https://trade-area-modelling.streamlit.app/). If the app has gone to sleep, simply wake it up.
