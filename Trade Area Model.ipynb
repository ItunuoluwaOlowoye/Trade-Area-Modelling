    "# Trade Area Modeling\n",
    "According to [Market Business News](https://marketbusinessnews.com/financial-glossary/trade-area-definition-meaning/), a trade (or market) area is the geographical area  where all or most of a business' sales volume occurs. It can be used to make decisions about the optimum location for business growth and expansion.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different trade area model and in this use case, we will be using the widely accepted [Huff model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huff_model). The Huff model uses the **distance** between customers and existing business locations, or locations that are planned for the future, along with the **attractiveness of those locations**, to determine the likelihood of customers visiting those locations."

    "## Case Study\n",
    "A beauty and personal care brand (we'll call them Lotionfy) has thrived as an exclusively online business for the past two years. They serve a predominantly US market, have done some market research and this is what they have discovered.\n",
    "1. While the e-commerce share of total retail sales continues to rise, in-store shopping is still the preferred method for most US cusstomers and makes up a very large chunk of total retail sales. [[Reference](https://capitaloneshopping.com/research/online-vs-in-store-shopping-statistics/)]\n",
    "2. More online shoppers are opting to pick up orders in-store and shoppers are generally returning to stores; retailers are reaching customers with small-format stores to encourage impulse purchases and reach new markets, among other benefits[[Reference](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/consulting/articles/q1-2023-consumer-trends-report.html)]\n",
    "3. Online businesses are developing physical footprints to keep their customers loyal and give them additional touchpoints for the brand; customers themselves now prefer omnichannel experiences [[Reference](https://www.inc.com/rebecca-deczynski/the-future-of-retail-isnt-direct-to-consumer-brands-embracing-brick-mortar-2023.html)]\n",
    "\n",
    "In light of these, Lotionfy has decided to build their physical presence. To start, they have also decided to leverage partnerships with already existing [top department stores](https://www.junglescout.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Jungle-Scout-Consumer-Trends-Report-Q3-2023.pdf) in the US like Walmart, Target, Kohl's etc. They will be leveraging the small-format store approach by drilling down to neighborhood locations.\n",
    "They have decided to use a trade area model to know which cities to focus on and which store locations should be their areas of focus."
